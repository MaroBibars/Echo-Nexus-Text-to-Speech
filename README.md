## 🎮 About the Project

This project is the **first full-stack app** I’ve ever built — entirely from scratch — and crafted with a vision to showcase both my technical skills and my love for Riot Games. I built this before even starting my first year in Computer Science. Every part of this journey was self-taught: from routing in Flask, to designing the frontend, to handling user authentication and connecting with a database.

This isn’t just a project. It’s my passion on display. ❤️

## 📣 Why I Built This

I’m a huge fan of Riot Games — not just as a player, but as someone who deeply respects the quality, care, and creativity Riot puts into every product. My dream is to one day intern and grow with the Riot team, and this is my first public step toward that goal.

If you’re from Riot (or the community), I hope this gives you a glimpse of my drive, skills, and how much I care about game development and user experience.
